Version history Smart Virtual Thermostat:
0.0.1: alpha
0.0.2: beta, with new connection object from Domoticz Python plugin framework
0.0.3: bug fixes + added thermostat temp update even if in Off or Forced modes
0.0.4: more logging parameters
0.1.0: Use the standard urllib.request module to call the Domoticz API due to ongoing changes to
        the Domoticz.Connection method
0.1.1: Address strange behavior of python plugin framework where no more than a couple of devices can be
        created and updated in one pass in the same function... so devices are created in "OnStart()" as
        required but are only updated after all required devices are created
0.2.0: First incremental update:
        - Code cleanup for calls to Domoticz API
        - Timeout for temperature sensors, based on Domoticz preferences setting
0.2.1: Fixed possible TypeError in datetime.strptime method in embedded Python
        (known python 3.x bug, see https://bugs.python.org/issue27400)
0.3.0: Fixed major bug in auto-learning + cosmetic improvements
0.3.1: Force immediate recalculation when setpoint changes
0.3.2: fix bug where thermostat might still switch on despite no valid inside temperature
0.3.3: various improvements:
        - end of heating cycle code adjusted to avoid potentially damaging quick off/on to the heater(s)
        - fix start up sequence to kill heating if mode is off in case heating was manually on beforehand
        - ensure heating is killed if invalid temperature reading (v.s. just setting mode to off)
0.3.4: immediate recalculation if mode changed (and skip learning since incomplete cycle).
        Thanks to domoticz forum user @Electrocut
0.3.5: fixed bug if calculated power is below minimum power
        Thanks to domoticz forum user @napo7
0.3.6: fixed bug causing auto learning to fail if no outside temp is provided
        Thanks to domoticz forum user @etampes
0.3.7: changed the logic for minimum power: apply minimum power even if no heating needed (useful for
        very high thermal inertia systems like heating floors that work better if kept warm enough)
        Thanks to domoticz forum user @napo7
0.3.8: minor improvements to thermostat temperature update logic, some code cleanup
0.3.9: GitHub contribution from @SoaR245: add support for domoticz webserver authentication if enabled
0.4.0: unpublished version (test of Domoticz.Connection method vs. urllib.request)
0.4.1: Cumulative update:
       (1) add option to force or not minimum heating per cycle even if target temperature
           is already reached (thanks to domoticz forum user @jake)
       (2) check heater(s) switch status before an update to avoid issuing uncessary switching commands
           (thanks to domoticz forum user @jake)
       (3) some minor error checks added when parsing parameters at startup
       (4) implement new debugging levels introduced by @dnpwwo
       (5) some code cleanup and optimization
0.4.2: Unpublished test
0.4.3: Call domoticz json API at least every 5 minutes to avoid the 10 mins timout of connections that
        floods domoticz's log with "Incoming Connection from ...." messages. Take advantage of this to
        update the temperature readings more often than upon each calculation
0.4.4: implement list of active/dead sensors to avoid continuous logging of dead sensors,
        also added some ´fool proof´ error handlers based on users feedback
0.4.5: adjust uservariable creation to breaking change introduced by domoticz version 4.10298
        thanks to GitHub contributor @informagico
0.4.6: some clean up of logging levels (accept older versions of domoticz) and variables scoping/typing
0.4.7: slight adjustement to verbose logging to reduce clutter
0.4.8: change behavior if no valid inside temperature reading: switch heating off instead of switching
        the thermostat off... then if and when there is a valid temperature the thermostat resumes work
        Thanks to GitHub user @Kptn77 for suggestion.
0.4.9 (February 1, 2020):
        bugfix to prevent crash with unreliable outside temp sensors (thanks to Github user @jjouifi)
        minor code cleanup + move version history from plugin.py to history.txt file
0.4.10 (November 25, 2020):
        bugfix on setting minimum force mode duration (thanks to domoticz forum user mash47)
0.4.11  (January 29, 2021): rrozema
        bugfixes for:
		(1) also learn when overshot (to improve learning rate)
		(2) always use the same time per heartbeat (fixes inprecision in time calculations)
		(3) increase precision of learn values to 2 decimals (fixes rounding issues)
		(4) also learn when Tin matches setpoint (fixes we only go up, never down)
		(5) increased maxdelta so we don't cut off the learning process to soon (fixes power going to 0 
		       all the time, which causes uncomfortable long times without heating)
